<h1>PickMe</h1>

<p>PickMe is an application that helps an adopter with their perfect pet. Many times people go to the shelter and adopt a pet purely based on their looks. The user will fill out information about themselves. Based on the information they provide, users will receive pet recommendations.</p>
<p>For example, John lives in a studio apartment and works 8 hours a day. Because of that, all the large dogs over 50lb will be removed from the recommendations, since most of the apartments do not allow large dogs, and a small studio apartment won't be suitable for a large dog.</p>
